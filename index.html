        <p class="top-header-part">
            Being caring and compassionate for ones fellow human beings is a central part of Islam. When reading the Quran, one cannot help being struck by the number of times charity is mentioned: Feeding the poor and needy, supporting orphans, relatives and travellers, spending in the way of Allah… All of these references emphasise the importance of charity for every Muslim. Donating is a selfless act. It feels good to help others.

          <h4>Education for a child</h4>
          <p>
            We have a kids education program which aims at enabling children from particularly vulnerable and underprivileged backgrounds to develop their social and academic potential as a key to happiness in life. Children left vulnerable due to the loss of parents, abuse or extreme deprivation need a lot more support and care to help them achieve their social and academic potential. We are trying to give those children a better way to the future.
